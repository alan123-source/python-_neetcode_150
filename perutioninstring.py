# 1. Sliding Window
#
# Instead of checking all substrings of length len(s1) (which would be O(n*m)), we keep a fixed-size window of len(s1) and just slide it across s2.
#
# Window size is constant â†’ len(s1).
#
# Each step only adds 1 character (right) and removes 1 character (left).
# ðŸ‘‰ Key Pattern: When searching for substrings of fixed length, use sliding window.
#
# 2. Frequency Counting (Array instead of Hash Table)
#
# We need to know if two substrings have the same characters (just permuted).
#
# Instead of sorting (which would be O(m log m)), we compare frequency counts of letters.
#
# Because only lowercase English letters are used, we can use a 26-size array ([0]*26) instead of a dictionary.
# ðŸ‘‰ Key Pattern: Use fixed-size frequency arrays for character counts when input domain is small (like lowercase letters).
#
# 3. Efficient Match Tracking
#
# Naively, you could compare two frequency arrays at every step â†’ O(26) per step.
#
# But here, the trick is to keep a running matches counter (how many characters match between the two windows).
#
# So instead of checking full arrays every time, you only update matches when one character is added/removed.
# ðŸ‘‰ Key Pattern: Keep a running metric (matches) to avoid re-comparing entire structures each step.
#
# 4. Fixed-Window vs Variable-Window
#
# This problem is fixed window (always size len(s1)), unlike some substring problems where you expand and shrink dynamically (longest substring without repeating, etc).
# ðŸ‘‰ Key Pattern: Decide early whether the sliding window size is fixed or variable.
#
# 5. Permutation Check via Character Counts
#
# A permutation of a string has the same character frequency as the original string.
#
# So, instead of generating permutations (which is exponential), just compare counts.
# ðŸ‘‰ Key Pattern: Many permutation-related problems reduce to comparing frequency counts.
