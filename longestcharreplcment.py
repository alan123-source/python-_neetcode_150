# ðŸ”‘ Key Patterns to Remember
# 1. Sliding Window
#
# You always use two pointers l and r.
#
# Expand r to include new characters.
#
# Shrink l only when the condition is violated.
#
# 2. Character Frequency Map
#
# Use a hashmap (count) to track frequency of characters in the current window.
#
# This tells you how many of each character you have inside the window.
#
# 3. Valid Window Condition
#
# Window length = (r - l + 1)
#
# Max frequency of a single character = max(count.values())
#
# If (window size - max frequency) <= k â†’ âœ… window is valid.
#
# Else â†’ shrink window by moving l.
